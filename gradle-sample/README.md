# Gradle Notes

## Advantages over Ant or Maven
* Is a structural and organazed as Maven. Folder structure is the same. 
* It can be customized as Ant.
* SUPER fast, because it keeps track of the changes done in the files, to only compile those and then ones that are dependent to those changes.
* Keeps in cache the previous build results.
